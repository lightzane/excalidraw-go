# Excalidraw Go

https://excalidraw.com/

**Excalidraw** is actually a virtual collaborative whiteboard tool that lets you easily sketch diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.

**Go** is a board game between two players.

Now you get the idea 😉

## Getting Started

1. Upload the resources (`svg`) files for the board and stones to Excalidraw.
2. Hold `Alt` + `drag` the stones to automatically generate a copy.

Then use `Live Collaboration` feature in the Excalidraw website.
